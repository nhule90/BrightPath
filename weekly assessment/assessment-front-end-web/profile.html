                You wonder why Asian kids mostly are good at math? I have a story to tell you!

            <p><img class = 'profile' src="https://tinyurl.com/asianmathkid" alt="Asian Math kid">
           First of all, Asian kids are good at Math because we have to! We really do not have a lot of options to choose when we were kids. The definition of a 'good' student in our culture is good at MATH. </p>           
           <p>
            Secondly, in all developing countries, as mine when I grew up, money was the biggest concern to all families. And you know, learning sports are more expensive than learning Math. Think about it in details and you'll know what I mean. To learn sport, we need equipments, and those equipments cost hugely. But if you want to learn Math, you only need papers and a pencil and you are good to go! Our parents did that simple calculation and decided what we need to learn is Math and only Math!     </p>

            <h2>Biology and coding</h2>
            <h4>My two biggest passions: biology and coding. Let me tell you how I found them!</h4>
            <p><img src="https://tinyurl.com/bioinformaticsnhu" alt="bioinformatics"> I knew that I love Science and Biology since the first day I learn about DNA and RNA. I just cannot stop being amazed at how much small little things can define the whole world. And that is the reason I become a Biologist. I was originally a wet-lab person, meaning that I would be at the lab bench, doing experiments with all the tubes, flasks, pippets,etc. Those things may seem boring to others, but that was my life for about 10 years and I loved it with all my heart. </p>
            <p>
            However, more than two years when COVID hit us, I can no longer come to lab and continue my research. But I cannot just stop because I was in my 3rd year of PhD program. That is when I learnt more about coding and realized how wonderful things could be and how interesting my research could become if I applied coding in Biology as a bioinformatist! I spent a lot of time learning code, starting with Python. I am not gonna say it was easy because it is not. Coding was challenging for me and it is still now. But somehow the challenge motivates me to learn more and to become better at it.             </p>
