// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning
Planing-Analysis of Requirements-Design-Implementation-Testing & Integration-Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis = "This is the second step, in which the end goal is to understand all the criterias and requirements from customers to build the software."
const Design = "This is the third step, in which the end goal is to have a workflow on paper. Developers will sketch their ideas and make plans on how to code efficiently."
const Implementation = " This is the forth step, in which the end goal is to transfer all the ideas on paper to real codes."
const Testing = "This is the fifth step, in which the end goal is to test the outcome of the program. Developers will check to see if the program meets all requirements."
const Maintain = "This is the last step, in which the end goal is to keep the program runs smoothly."
